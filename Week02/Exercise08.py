x = 6
print(x > 6 and x < 10)
print(x > 8 or x < 17)
print(not(x > 8 or x < 17))

'''
its actually just simple logics because
x = 6 so that means that x > 6 returns false
and x < 10 returns true because x is less then 10

same goes for x > 8 that also returns false 
and x is less then 17 because x = 6
and because the or statement only needs 1 statement to be true it returns true

and for the last print statement its all in reverse so true is false and false is true
so x is greater then 8 that's true but reversed so false 
and the or statement x is less then 17 but its reversed so that's also false 
so it should also return false because it doesnt have 1 true statement
